# Story Driven Development (SDD)

```
A lean software development process driven by stories. 
```

## Story

A product consists of features.  
A story is a description of such a product feature.  


## Software development process
The software development process is a systematic approach used to develop software.  
It consists of key stages: planning, analysis, design, coding, testing, deployment and maintenance.  
Each stage has its specialists, people with stage-specific knowledge.  
Each story progresses through these stages, with the respective parties handling the story according to the stage-specific requirements.   
<!--Each story gets a dedicated team assigned.
    A story is delivered when it is successfully deployed, a story is never done.-->



## Story driven planning

A story must have business value to be part of the backlog.  
A story can be part of a larger entity, known as an epic.  
A story has a list of stage-specific tasks.  
A story with the most business value should be delivered first.  
A story is owned by a dedicated team.  
A release is one to many stories driven.

Suggestions:
* status board
* docs as code
* Kanban philosophy (story iterations instead of fixed iterations)

## Story driven Analysis

A story has an ubuiquitous name and description.  
A story has a happy path.  
A story has zero to many error paths.  
A story has zero to many variations.  
A story has zero to many dependencies on other stories (pre/postconditions).  
<!-- -->
Suggestions:
* docs as code

## Story driven Design

A story adheres to the SOLID principle.  
TODO
<!-- -->
Suggestions:
* Story driven architecture (aka Vertical slice architecture)

## Story driven Coding

A story is a contract.  
A story is coded following its ubuiquitous language.  
TODO
<!-- -->
Suggestions:
* 

## Story driven Testing

A story is tested as a whole (blackbox).  
Story internals are tested as units (whitebox).  
<!-- -->
Suggestions:
* 

## Story driven Deployment

A story has its own branch.  
A story has its own deployment.  
<!-- -->
Suggestions:
* Feature based deployment: story = feature
* deploy a story as a function

## Story driven Maintenance

A bug is always filed or fixed in the context of a story.
