# Story Driven Development (SDD)


## What?
An *agile software development process* driven by **stories**.

The core stages of the software development process are planning, analysis, design, coding, testing, deployment and maintenance.
A story is a description of a feature or requirement of your product.
Each story progresses through these stages, with the respective parties handling the story according to the stage-specific requirements.
