## What?
An *agile software development process* driven by (user) **stories**.

The main stages of the process are analysis, design, coding, testing, deployment and planning.
Every story progresses through each stage, with the respective parties handling the story according to the requirements of their stage.




## Mission

*Trust the process and focus on the quality of the story during every stage*



## Vision
To revolutionize the software development industry by setting the standard for excellence through universally adopted best practices, enabling teams to deliver high-quality software efficiently and effectively




## Disclaimer
Software is always about PEOPLE.
A methodology alone is never a guarantee of success.
