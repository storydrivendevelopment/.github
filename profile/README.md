# Story Driven Development (SDD)


## What is SDD?
An agile software development process driven by (user) stories.

The main stages of the process are analysis, design, coding, testing, deployment and planning.


## Goal of SDD
SDD provides a blueprint of best practice tools for every stage in the software development process.
By doing so you save time and are able to focus on the stories. 
Trust the process.


## Disclaimer
Software is always about PEOPLE.
A methodology alone is never a guarantee of success.
