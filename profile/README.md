# Story Driven Development (SDD)


## What?
An agile software development process driven by (user) stories.

The main stages of the process are analysis, design, coding, testing, deployment and planning.
Each story progresses through each stage, with the respective parties handling the story according to the requirements of their stage.


## Mission
To provide a blueprint of best practice tools for every stage in the software development process.

This approach saves you time, allowing you to focus on the quality of the story during every stage. 

//Trust the process.


## Disclaimer
Software is always about PEOPLE.
A methodology alone is never a guarantee of success.
